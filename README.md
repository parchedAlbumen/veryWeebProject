# veryWeebProject
A project that I wanna use to learn how to connect programming languages with another,, I want to create a python gui,, with a GOlang backend,, kind of cool,, also it's about mangas

- if you want to try this out,, clone this whole thing 
make the server.go run in the background, and then run the python file
when you type something with spaces,, right now it can't handle white spaces so if you want to type something like "one piece", you actually 
have to write it like, "one-piece" 

anyways have fun for now,, i'll do more updates and stuff,, please tell me any features that would seem cool on this, because I am limited to what I only like, so maybe other peoples idea might make my project more interesting.
