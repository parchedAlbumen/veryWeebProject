# veryWeebProject
A project that I wanna use to learn how to connect programming languages with another,, I want to create a python gui,, with a GOlang backend,, kind of cool,, also it's about mangas

- if you want to try out this thing rn:
clearly it isn't done but u can run the program and then go to another terminal and either type one of these:
curl http://localhost:3333/naruto    -> currently only gives u the type of naruto, I am going to expand on this later
curl http://localhost:3333           -> just prints something 
curl http://localhost:3333/hello      -> just says hello
